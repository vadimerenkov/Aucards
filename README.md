Aucards is a free and open-source app where you can create colorful communication cards to help you communicate with others.

App is based on the concept of "autistic cards", which people with special needs use to quickly communicate their feelings, their requests or inform others of their conditions.

If you've ever experienced the need to say something when you couldn't, for example, in a moment of autistic shutdown, when you are too overwhelmed to speak, then this app is for you.
It is designed to be as frictionless as possible to minimize the effort needed to express what you feel right now.

Highlights:

- Create an endless amount of cards with unique messages
- Choose any color from a rich palette â€“ or create your own!
- Organize your cards however you like: drag them around or add to favourites
- Easy to use: just tap on the card to open it in fullscreen!
- Bring your cards to any device: easily export and transfer them wherever you like
- Play a sound to let others know you want to say something
- Completely free, open source and no ads â€“ ever!

Who can benefit from this app:

- People with autism/adhd
- Children who have difficulties with verbal communication
- Elderly people who need assistance
- Or anyone in a situation where you can't speak: on a loud concert or a lecture!
